<h1>Terms of Use</h1>
<p>Data disseminated by the World Bank under its Open Data policy are provided under the <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/summary-terms-of-use" target="_blank">Open Data terms of use</a>. These terms of use apply to data provided through our <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog" target="_blank">Data Catalog</a>. A number of concerns prevent the World Bank from providing similar unconditional and unrestricted access to microdata. </p>

<ul class="bl"><li>Microdata are unit-level data obtained from sample surveys, censuses, and administrative systems. They provide information about characteristics of individual people or entities such as households, business enterprises, facilities, farms or even geographical areas such as villages or towns. One main concern is the need to protect, as far as possible, the privacy of the individual respondents that have provided the data. Much of the microdata have been collected under a mandate provided by different kinds of national statistical legislation, which contain requirements for data about individuals to be treated as confidential by anyone collecting and using such data.  Further, the microdata may be protected by copyright or other intellectual property protections under different intellectual property legislation. The Microdata Library adopts rules and procedures that are consistent with the type of legislation concerning this information around the world.</li>
<li>The Microdata Library operates as a portal. It disseminates micro-datasets from two sources: those that belong to the World Bank and those where the data have been generated and are owned by another agency. A number of micro-datasets have been provided to the Microdata Library by third parties including member states, international or regional agencies, and World Bank contractors. In many cases the arrangements that have allowed the datasets to be made available to the World Bank include limitations on how the data can be disseminated to users. The Microdata Library is obliged to put these arrangements into effect.</li> </ul>
<p>For these reasons, the Microdata Library disseminates data under some restrictions, the terms of which vary by source, as well as according to the individual characteristics of each microdata set. While the Microdata Library remains governed by the Terms of Use for the World Bank's datasets, it is subject to additional terms, described below. If these additional Microdata terms are inconsistent with the general Terms of Use, then these specific Microdata terms shall govern.</p> 
<p>To protect the confidentiality of individual information and to meet the requirements of the data owners who provide the microdata sets, the Microdata Library has various types of access that may be applied to specific datasets. The various possible access policies under which data may be made accessible include direct access, public use files, licensed files, files accessible in a data enclave and policy defined by an external repository. Other data dissemination options are possible, although not currently implemented by the Microdata Library. These various options are described in generic terms below; the exact formulation of these policies may differ when applied by external contributing repositories.</p>
<p>Regardless of the access method in place for any dataset, all potential users are required to agree to a disclaimer, in which they agree to follow the Terms of Use applicable to the Microdata Library, and acknowledge that the original collector of the data, the Microdata Library and the relevant funding agency bear no responsibility for any use of the data or for interpretations or inferences based upon such uses.</p> <p>The World Bank makes no claim about the quality of the data or its suitability for any type of analysis or use. The World Bank shall have the right, but no obligation, to monitor use of microdata obtained from the Microdata Library, and may decide, in its discretion, whether an abuse has taken place. The World Bank shall have absolute discretion to determine whether to sanction users for violations, and penalties may include restrictions or denial of further access to the Microdata Library, or any other World Bank Group resources.</p>
<p>Each item in the Microdata Library shall be subject to one of the following access and use categories, and users must agree to comply with those conditions associated with the items they wish to access.</p>

               <p><em>Licensed files</em> are files whose dissemination is restricted to <em>bona fide</em> users - authenticated users with legitimate need to access  the data - who have received authorization to access them after submitting a  documented application and signing an agreement governing the data's use. These  users must be acting on behalf of an organization, who must take responsibility for the use. The following conditions apply (specific datasets may differ in formulation, but will have similar  principles):</p>
				<ul class="bl">
				  <li>Data and other material provided by the Microdata Library will be used solely by the user, and  shall not be redistributed or sold to other individuals, institutions or organizations without the Microdata Library's prior written agreement, and only  subject to such conditions as may accompany such consent. </li>

				  <li>The Microdata Library and the relevant funding agencies bear no responsibility for the data's use or for interpretation or inferences based upon it. </li>
				  <li>As a condition to access Licensed Files, the user's organization must be identified, as must the principal and other researchers who will be involved in using the data at that organization. The principal researcher may be asked to sign a license on behalf of the organization. If the principal researcher is not authorized to sign on behalf of the receiving organization, a suitable representative must be  identified. Any violation of the Microdata  Terms of Use will be considered to have occurred on behalf of the user's  organization, and we will take appropriate measures to sanction such  misconduct, which may include denying any further and future access by any user  from that organization.</li>
				  <li>The intended use of the data, including a list of expected outputs and the organization's dissemination policy must be identified and no different uses shall be  permitted without prior written consent from the World Bank.</li>
				  <li>The World Bank shall have the right, but no obligation, to  monitor use of Microdata obtained from the Microdata Library, and may decide, in its discretion, whether an abuse has taken place.  The World Bank shall have absolute discretion  to determine whether to sanction users for violations, and penalties may  include restrictions or denial of further access to the Microdata library, or any other World Bank Group resources.</li>

                <p>For some specialized datasets, access may only be offered through a <em>data enclave</em>. This is a facility equipped with computers not linked to the internet or an external network and from which  no information can be downloaded in any form drives. Data enclaves contain data  that are particularly sensitive or allow direct or easy identification of respondents.</p>
				<p> Users interested in accessing these datasets will be asked to complete an application form demonstrating a legitimate need to access these data to fulfill a stated statistical or  research purpose. When datasets are only available through a data enclave, arrangements will have to be made with the originating data repository for  access to be provided.</p>
				<p>The World Bank does not operate a data enclave (although Bank staff members, and researchers working with Bank staff under a Bank project, may be provided with access to datasets available to the Bank but not publicly disseminated).</p>

            <div id="external" style="height:150px;" >
                <p>The Microdata Library operates both as a data catalog for World Bank data and as a portal for external repositories. Datasets provided by external agencies are not owned or controlled by the Bank and have their own conditions of use. When a user accesses external repositories, these Terms and Conditions no longer apply, and the terms governing use of those external repositories shall govern access to their data.  The World Bank is not responsible in any way for the external repositories, their terms, or their collections.</p>

            <div id="other">
                <p>Other possible forms of access to microdata include remote job submission and remote access to microdata where users have no direct access to them. These may or may not be available for any individual item in the Microdata Library, and the World Bank has no obligation to make items available under these conditions.</p>
                <h3>Job Submission</h3>
                <p>One approach to making it possible for users to conduct analyses of confidential data is creating a process that enables them to submit data processing and analysis programs remotely to the data depositor. The user is given a synthetic dataset that replicates the structure and content of the actual datasets. This enables the researcher to develop programs using tools such as SAS, SPSS or Stata. The programs are then transmitted to the data depositor staff, who run the job against the actual dataset. The results are then vetted for disclosure and returned to the user.</p>
                <h3>Remote Data Access</h3>
                <p>This consists of providing users with access to web-based data tabulation and analysis software, with no possibility of users downloading datasets or generating tables that would reveal individual or small numbers of records. </p>
				<p>The World Bank does not provide a Job Submission service. Some datasets may be accessible through a remote tabulation or analysis system. When this is the case, a link to such systems is provided. </p>
