<h1>Using our catalog</h1>
<p>The Microdata Catalog displays a list of all microdata available in the Microdata Library. The full collection of microdata in the catalog can be viewed from the DATASETS tab in the Microdata Catalog. The catalog has a number of features which allows the display of results to be limited to specific search criteria as well as a tool for comparing variables.</p>

<p>Click on the bar labeled Countries in the Search dialog box to expand it.</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li>Select the countries you want to display in the catalog by clicking on the box\boxes next to your country\countries of interest. The filter is automatically applied as you click.</li>
<li>To select all countries click on <em><strong>select all</strong></em> in the top right of the Countries dialog box.</li>
<li>To clear your selection click on <em><strong>clear</strong></em> in the top right top right of the Countries dialog box.</li>

<div class="box1">
  <p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span>To filter your results by the year of the study, select the start and end years from the drop down boxes: <img src="images/year_search_help.png" alt="Year Filter"><br/></p>
</div>
<a name="searching"></a><h3>Searching in Study and or Variable Description
</h3>
<p>To search for keywords in the study description and display the studies containing those keywords, fill in your keywords in the first text box. For example: Title, Primary Investigator,Funder, Series, Study Abbreviation, would be relevant in this field.
</p>
<p><b>Important:</b> The system is only able to find keywords found in the metadata entered for a study. In cases where metadata is incomplete, such as where variable lables are missing in the data, results for that study may not be returned even though the particular topic you are searching for was covered in the study.  
Also note that many of the datasets are documented in languages other than English. In such cases searches conducted using English keywords will not return results from studies conducted in other languages. If you know a study was conducted in say, Spanish, then you should use Spanish keywords in your search.</p>
<ul class="bl">
<li>To search for keywords in the study variable description and display the studies containing those keywords, fill in your keywords in the second text box. For example: gender, labor, health, age, house, employed, weight, height, expenditure, income etc.</li>
<li>To limit this search in variable description to only the <em><strong>variable name</strong></em>, <em><strong>label</strong></em>, <em><strong>question</strong></em> or <em><strong>classification</strong></em><strong></strong>, tick one of the boxes below the second text box.</li>
<li>Initiate the search by clicking on the <img src="files/help-search-submit.png" alt="search"> button. To start a new search from the beginning click on the <img src="files/help-search-reset.png" alt=""> button.</li>
</ul>

<a name="variable"></a> <h3>Displaying the variable description search results</h3>
  <p>After running the search a list of studies will be displayed which contain the keywords you searched on. A count is given of the number of variables in the study which meet your search criteria <img src="files/help-variable-expand.png" alt="Keyword count" align="absbottom">. Clicking on this line will list all those variables.</p>
<p><img src="files/help-variable-search.png" alt="Keyword List" class="img-1"></p>

<p>Clicking on the <img src="images/question.png" alt="question">icon will display more details about that variable in a new box. To generate a PDF of the results click on the <img src="images/pdf.png" alt="PDF">icon or to print the results click on the <img src="images/printer.png" alt="print">icon.</p>
<p>To close this window click on the X in the top right hand corner of the box.</p>
<p><img src="files/help-variable-info.png" alt="Variable Expand" class="img-1"/></p>

<a name="compare"></a><h3>Comparing variables</h3>
<p>To compare or list the details of variables from your search results. Select the variables you want to compare and then click on <em><strong>Compare</strong></em><strong></strong> in the top right of your search results window.</p>
<p><img src="files/help-variable-add-compare.png" alt="compare" class="img-1"/></p>
<p>A box will open displaying your comparison.</p>
<p><img src="files/help-variable-compare.png" alt="Compare Results" class="img-1"/></p>
<p>You may change the order of the variable descriptions by simply dragging the variable box to your desired location. Do this by holding the left mouse button down and dragging the content with your mouse at the same time. Printing the contents of the compare box as well as generating a PDF document is also possible. Click on the relevant text at the top of the box to print or generate a PDF.</p>

<a name="sort"></a><h3>Sort results by</h3>
<p>Click on the field name to sort the catalog display by <strong>Title</strong>, <strong>Year </strong>or <strong>Country</strong>. The first click sorts the result in ascending order; on a second click the sort is performed in descending order. The up/down arrow indicates the direction of the sort.</p>
<p><img src="images/sort_title_year_country.png" alt="Sort results by"></p>

<a name="tips"></a><h3>Search Tips</h3>
<p>The Microdata Catalog uses Full-Text Search. This allows you to search the full text of all metadata for all the studies in the catalog.</p> 
<p>The full text includes all fields in:</p>

<ul class="bl">
<li>the study description - for example -  in study title, collection date, study producer, study abbreviation, study sponsors, keywords, etc.</li>
<li>the variable description - for example - in the variable name, variable label, variable value labels, variable literal question, etc.</li>  
</ul>  
  
<p></p>Full-Text Search uses "natural language" or Boolean search operators to retrieve the information you need.</p>
<p> Natural language searches are searches conducted using the language you would use in speaking to a person. For example:  <b>drinking water sources in rural areas.</b></p>
<p>Boolean searching allows you to narrow, broaden, or limit a search by connecting search terms with Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and NOT. <b>Note:</b> these must be written in CAPS. Some examples of how to conduct searches using Boolean operators are shown below :</p>


<a name="examples"></a><h3>Search Examples</h3>
<ul class="bl">
<li>Multiple keywords listed in a field separated by <strong>spaces</strong> will yield search results containing all studies that meet any of the typed criteria. A list of keywords will therefore be treated as an <strong>OR</strong> statement. For example: Listing <strong>gender age</strong> in the variable description will show all studies that have either gender or age in their variable description.<br><br></li>
<li>Placing <strong>AND</strong> between words treats the search as an <strong>AND</strong> statement. For example :<strong> Gender  AND Education AND Employed</strong> will limit results to studies that contain all the elements, Gender and Education and Employed in them.<br><br></li>
<li>Placing <strong>NOT</strong> between words treats the search as a<strong> NOT statement.</strong> For example:<strong> Albania AND Kenya NOT World</strong> will limit results to studies that contain all the elements Albania and Kenya, but exclude results for World from the results.<br><br></li>
<li>Placing quotation marks <strong>""</strong> around a search term will force the term to be evaluated as one term. For example: to limit a search to study descriptions that contain the exact sequence of words<em> health study</em> in them one would type <strong><em>"</em>Health Study<em>"</em> </strong>between quotation marks. Without the quotation marks the search would show all studies with health or study in them. With the quotation marks only studies with the exact wording in the sequence <em>health study</em> will be shown.<br><br></li>
<li>Substituting letters in words or phrases with a wildcard <strong>asterisk *</strong> is allowed. For example searching for heat<strong>*</strong> would yield results for heating, heated, heater.<br><br></li>
<li>The wildcard<strong> ? </strong>may also be used in searches to substitute for letters. For example: searching for <strong>employ?</strong> would yield results for employ or employed.<br><br></li>
</ul>
